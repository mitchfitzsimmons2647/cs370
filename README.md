Emerging Trends: AI and Machine Learning
The work on this project was to better understand the different fields in the associated project. We were given a large chunk of the code, and had to understand it from the given readings, notes, and comments found in the code. Given all this, we were to manipulate fields like the learning rate to better understand how AI learned and how to optimally set them up in a way that they would learn best. While the answer is unique in each given system, the .ipnyb file attached shows the process. A computer scientists overall goals are to understand and break down a problem into feasible steps. From that they can create applications and functions to solve said goals, in an optimally automatic fashion, to save time and resources compared to the counterpart of manually doing it. As a computer scientist I follow this logic in how I approach problems and projects, as well as how I learn different concepts including the ones in this class. My ethical responsibilities to the end user and organizations is to provide solutions that are unbiased, and optimally made for efficiency and longevity. A better experience for the end-user and organization alongside optimally funcitoning solutions is how a computer scientist like myself can create ethical nonbiased solutions for problems in almost any context.
